This is a demo for the paper Behavior-Guided Reinforcement Learning, currently under review. 

We would like you to focus on the notebook Demo.ipynb, where we go through an example of how to calculate the behavioral test functions (Algorithm 1 in the paper) and use them to solve reinforcement learning environment with Behavior-Guided Evolution Strategies (BGES).

We wrote this code specifically for educational purposes to build intuition around our method, as we understand that it does include several technical steps. It is designed to run on a single machine. We hope this helps a wide range of people learn about our approach, and maybe get in touch to collaborate! The code requires a MuJoCo license, which can be obtained from https://www.roboti.us/license.html. All full-time students get this for free. 

If there are any questions, please feel free to get in touch at behaviorguidedRL@gmail.com. We would also be interested in assisting anyone in scaling up this method to a distributed setting.
